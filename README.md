## Code Overview

- `gameSeq`: Array to store the generated color sequence.
- `userSeq`: Array to store the user's input sequence.
- `started`: Flag to check if the game has started.
- `level`: Variable to track the current level.
- `h2` and `h3`: DOM elements for displaying the current level and highest score.
- `btns`: Array of color names.

The game logic is implemented using event listeners, animations, and functions to handle user input, level progression, and game over scenarios.
